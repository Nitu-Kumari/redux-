# Redux
~~~
redux is one of the hottest library for front end development.
it is the npm module.
it  manage the application store.
~~~

# Component of redux
~~~
. Action
. Reducer
.Store
.View

Actions
Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.
Actions are plain JavaScript objects.
 Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. 
~~~
#Reducers
~~~
Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. 
that means how the state will change.
~~~
#Store
~~~
Store is the object that brings them together.

store has the following responsibilities:

Holds application state;

Allows access to state via getState();

Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);

Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);

Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).
~~~

#Data Flow
~~~
unidirectional data flow.
~~~
# Redux Usage with React
~~~
first step
add your project
npm install --save react-redux
~~~
# Presentational and Container Components used Redux Example
~~~
                   Presentational Components	          Container Components
  
  To read data   	Read data from props	               Subscribe to Redux state
To change data  	Invoke callbacks from props               	Dispatch Redux actions
Are written     	By hand	                                   Usually generated by React Redux

# Implementing Presentational Components
~~~

import React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
// todo means your app name

const Todo = ({ onClick, completed, text }) => (
  <li
    onClick={onClick}
    style={{
      textDecoration: completed ? 'line-through' : 'none'
    }}
  >
    {text}
  </li>
)

Todo.propTypes = {
  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  completed: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

export default Todo

#Implementing Other Components
~~~
import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { addTodo } from '../actions'

let AddTodo = ({ dispatch }) => {
  let input

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault()
          if (!input.value.trim()) {
            return
          }
          dispatch(addTodo(input.value))
          input.value = ''
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
AddTodo = connect()(AddTodo)

export default AddTodo
